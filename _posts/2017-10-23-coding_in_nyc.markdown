Most people move to New York with a plan, but I found one after getting here. I probably should have just moved to some cheap place to live while I was doing Learn, but I was addicted to the energy of the city. 

I managed to keep myself afloat with a side job ghostwriting and editing blog posts, which paid very little, so I learned to live cheaply. Once I discovered the ins and outs of Brooklyn and Manhattan, I was able to survive on what it would cost me almost anywhere else in the United States. 

$1 pizza doesn’t taste much different than the expensive stuff. $3 goes a long way at a fruit stand in some parts of Harlem. Sashimi Express has some of the best $10 sushi in the country. And biking is free.  

Coding in the tiny space I had as an apartment drove me nuts. So I looked for a cheap space and was lucky to find an animation studio in Midtown called the Productive that had a deal that allowed me to come in after 6pm and on weekends for cheap. Schwarzman Library is beautiful and it's free during the day.

After about halfway through the program I had some difficulties with my living situation and my landlord (who thought programming was foolish). I got lucky again and overnight found a cheap spot in Washington Heights. 

I’m hoping the good fortune continues post-graduation.
