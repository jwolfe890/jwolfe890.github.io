As soon as I complete this blog post, I will have officially completed all my requirements for graduation. When I combined the difficulties of surviving in New York, as well as my natural high anxiety, it has been one of the most challenging periods of my life. 

However, throughout the two years I’ve been studying programming, I’ve learned some lessons that have made me more determined.  

As someone new to programming, a large challenge for me was trusting the process and realizing that my hard work was worth it. After visiting the Flatiron School, it was impossible not to become caught up in the authenticity and energy of the people involved, so I dropped the self studying I’d been doing and immediately started the program. 

I’d like to say I never worried again after that, but I found myself panicking every few weeks, sometimes to the point of wanting to give up everything. 

Anytime I had to look at the solution branch, I was struck by imposter syndrome. But coding felt so natural to me, so I kept going.  

Wired magazine or Tech Crunch would run stories about the death of coding, and I'd get worried. I’d turn to friends or if it was late at night Quora for re-assurance.  These stories won’t end. Talking about the oncoming A.I. apocalypse is too great for readership. 

I’d worry about stories about the dangers of bootcamps. These are another popular angle, particularly with the recent closing of Dev Bootcamp. There was also the endless amount of message boards of people claiming that coding bootcamps wouldn’t properly teach you how to code.

However, many of the outcomes I’d see from my fellow classmates clearly didn’t reflect the scenarios presented. Eventually, I learned to just keep going. 

Stories and people will doubt you, but they are only distractions. Surround yourself with those who will support your journey, and don’t let doomsday journalism sidetrack you. The people who succeed are the ones that block out the noise and just code.
